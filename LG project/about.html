			 <h2>About LG Company</h2>
			<p>
				Headquartered in Seoul, LG is a South Korean electronics manufacturer 
				founded as GoldStar by Koo In-hwoi in 1958. The company was set up to
				manufacture consumer electronics and home appliances for the local market
				after the Korean War. Therefore, it was the first to produce radio 
				equipment, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and air 
				conditioners in South Korea. While the company initially operated 
				under the GoldStar branding, it was later merged with Lucky Chemical 
				and LS Cable –other LG group companies – in 1995.
		   	</p>
			   <p>
				The company’s first overseas production facility was set up in the US in 1982.
				In 1994 GoldStar officially became LG Electronics. To expand its footprint in
				he US, LG acquired US-based television manufacturer Zenith and also launched
				the world’s first CDMA digital mobile phone in 1995. In 1999, the company
				made a joint venture with Philips, now known as LG Display, to design and
				develop liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
			   </p>
			   <p>
				LG Electronics made a significant contribution to the world’s consumer 
				electronics and home appliances industry. In 2005, it became one of the
				top 100 global brands in consumer electronics. As of 2009, its display 
				manufacturing unit, LG Display, had become the world’s largest LCD panel
				manufacturer. The company started making smartphones in 2010. It was one
				of the early original equipment manufacturers to adopt Google’s Android
				as default operating system for its smartphones.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				In 2014, in partnership with Google, the company also announced the
				Android Wear-based LG G Watch. The next year, the company launched 
				the LG Watch Urbane, the first LG watch to support smartwatch features
				such as WiFi.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				Today, LG Electronics is a global brand that manufactures and sells consumer
				electronics, mobile communications, and home appliances. Besides, it also 
				makes devices and products for commercial use — G-, V-, and F-series mobile
				communication products, in-vehicle infotainment, HVAC and motor, and 
				vehicle engineering components. In addition, the company also makes
				commercial display solutions, solar solutions, energy storage systems,
				energy management solutions, membranes, stylers and lighting products,
				besides compressors and motors.

			   <h3>LG Electronics researcher to head alliance for 6G technology in US</h3>
			   <p>
				researchers will head a working group in a North American mobile
				technology alliance for 6G technology development.
				Lee Ki-dong, a principal researcher at LG, was elected 
				the chair of the Applications working group in the
				Next G Alliance earlier this month, the company said. He has 
				been given a two-year term to lead the working group that 
				will address 6G-related application needs.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				The Next G Alliance was launched by the US-based Alliance for 
				Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) last October to 
				beef up mobile technology leadership in 6G
				It has a total of six working groups with 48 
				companies from telecommunications, software and 
				semiconductor fields serving as members.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				LG said 6G technology is expected to be commercialised in 2029, 
				with talks for standardisation beginning in 2025,reports Yonhap news agency.
				The next-generation telecommunications network will provide faster datspeed,
				lower latency and higher reliability than 5G and will be able to bring 
				the concept of Ambient Internet of Everything (AIoE), which provides
				enhanced connected experience to users.
