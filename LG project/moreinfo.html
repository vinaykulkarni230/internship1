            <ol>
            <li> Pricing( they are not pricing competitively)</li>
            <li> Innovation ( am not saying they are bad at innovation , they are
                actually super excellent but they are innovating something for
                each and every mobile and not considering the innovation of
                previous Mobile, so developers also can't work well for that
                single Mobile)
            </li>
            <li>
                Updates ( updates are usually slow from there track records) 
            </li>
            <li>
                Naming ( There is a big confusion in naming smartphone nowadays
                and LG is first of all , they will just name their smartphone with
                unusual order and very rare name which people can easily forget).
            </li>
            <li>LG announced its exit from the smartphone market earlier this week. 
                It wasn't a sudden move as the mobile division of the South Korean company 
                had been making losses for some time.
            </li>
            <li>
                The departure of LG from the smartphone market was a sad moment for at least some loyal customers. 
                On this week's episode of Orbital, the Gadgets 360 podcast, the discussion revolves around the exit 
                of LG from the smartphone market.

            <li>Counterpoint associate director Tarun Pathak joins host Akhil Arora and Gadgets 360 reviews
                 editor Jamshed Avari to talk about what made LG exit the market and why we saw it coming.
            </li>
			<li>As per latest regulatory filings with Registrar of Companies, LG India’s
				mobile phone business was Rs 190 crore as compared to its total business
				of Rs 15,709 crore in 2019-20. In fact, the mobile business was the only 
				loss-making unit in the Indian operation with gross loss of Rs 91 crore 
				in FY20.
			</li>
			<li>
				LG said its decision to exit the “incredibly competitive mobile phone sector” 
				is to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components,
				connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence,
				business-to-business solutions, platforms and services.
			</li>
			<li>
			LG said the winding down of the mobile phone business is expected to 
			be completed by July 31 although inventory of some existing models may
			still be available after that. The company said it will provide service
			support and software updates for customers of existing mobile products
			for a period of time.
